# Static Network

Configures the network on Linux hosts in order to force the network name
resolution to be static and not be changed by NetworkManager.

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```
    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - role: static_network
```
